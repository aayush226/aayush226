## Aayush Shah
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm Aayush â€” an AI Engineer and MS Computer Science student at NYU.  
ðŸ¤– I build intelligent systems that bridge research and real-world impact.  
ðŸ§  I love replicating papers like Attention is All You Need, RAG, and LoRA to truly understand *how* they work.  
âš¡ Currently working on graph-aware RAGs, safe MCP-powered agents, and efficient model fine-tuning.  
ðŸ’¬ I enjoy open-sourcing my work and explaining AI through my YouTube channel â€” *How Hard Can AI Be?* and in depth Medium Blogs.
